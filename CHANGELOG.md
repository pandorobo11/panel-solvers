# Changelog

This file is the source of truth for `panel-solvers` release notes. Product
compatibility versions are tracked separately under ADR 0007.

## [Unreleased]

- **Breaking:** Remove NPZ output, the `save_npz_on` case field, the Summary CSV
  `npz_path` column, and both compatibility frontends' `export_npz` API. Old
  case files must delete the `save_npz_on` column. Existing NPZ files are not
  automatically deleted; use VTP for visualization and panel data, and Summary
  CSV for aggregate results.
- Correct the optional ray-acceleration install hint to use the shared
  `panel-solvers[rayaccel]` distribution extra.
- Reject portable summary and planned-artifact path collisions after Unicode NFC
  normalization and casefolding, including existing symlink and hardlink aliases.
- Completed Phase 8 supported-domain compatibility remediation, final-candidate
  audit, release/rollback hardening, and durable acceptance reporting.
